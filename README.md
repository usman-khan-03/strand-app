## Installation

To install and run **Strands** on your local machine, follow the steps below:
To run the **Strands** app fully, including both the frontend and backend, follow these extended installation steps:

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js**: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- **Python**: Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and ensure it’s accessible from your command line.
- **Pip**: You’ll also need `pip`, which typically comes with Python. If not installed, [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed and configured on your system.

### Installation Steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/usman-khan-03/strands-app.git
   ```
   Then, navigate into the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd strands-app
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   After navigating into the project folder, install the frontend dependencies using npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies**:
   Navigate to the backend directory (for example, `backend/` if structured that way) and install the necessary Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command will install all the backend dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. **Run the backend server**:
   Once the dependencies are installed, start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This command should launch the backend, which will handle requests from the frontend.

5. **Run the frontend server**:
   Go back to the root directory of the project and start the frontend development server by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

6. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the frontend. The backend should be running at a different port, typically `http://localhost:5000` or as configured in the backend setup.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the frontend and backend are properly linked by verifying that API calls from the frontend are directed to the correct backend URL.
- For production, consider using tools like **Docker** for containerizing both frontend and backend, or tools like **nginx** to manage requests between frontend and backend more effectively.

These steps should help you set up and run both parts of the Strands app locally.

## Usage

Once you have the application running, you can begin creating and managing strands. Here’s a quick guide on how to get started:

1. **Creating a Strand**: Click on the "Create Strand" button on the homepage. Provide the required details such as title, description, and tags.
2. **Viewing Strands**: All created strands will appear on the homepage, categorized by tags or other criteria.
3. **Editing a Strand**: Click on any strand to view or edit its details.
4. **Deleting a Strand**: Use the delete option available under the strand details.
